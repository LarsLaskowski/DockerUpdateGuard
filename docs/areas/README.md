# Areas

What the software does, area by area. Each area has one document here that states the behavior a user, an
operator or another component can rely on — formats, limits, error behavior, guarantees. The
[decision records](../decisions/README.md) explain *why* individual choices were made; the area documents say
*what holds today*. `ARCHITECTURE.md` shows how the parts fit together and links the areas instead of repeating them.

## Rules

- **One document per area**, `docs/areas/<slug>.md`, created from [`_template.md`](_template.md) and listed in the
  index below. The squad Lead keeps it in step with the code: a change in behavior updates the area document in the
  same pull request.
- **Normative and stable.** Write what must hold, not how one language or library does it: the test is whether
  the document would still be true if the component were rewritten in another language. No class, package or
  function names as a contract (mention them only as a pointer to where it is implemented).
- **One home per behavior.** A cross-cutting topic (security, offline behavior) lives in the area that owns it; the
  others link there.
- **Size.** One readable document per area: split one that grows past a few thousand words, fold one that
  says only a few sentences into a neighbor. Development and release process are not areas (see
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
- **A new area is a Lead decision** made in the plan (`plan.md`, *Areas*), with its name and scope in the index.
- Every decision record names its area in its `Area:` field (`—` for a record about the process). Area documents are
  not frozen by a release; their history is Git.
